        <h1>SAFE, SECURE JOBS AND A HEALTHY, SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT</h1>
        <p>Each year about 135,000 New Jersey workers suffer a job-related disease or injury. New Jersey also has huge

environmental problems. We breathe unhealthy air one out of three summer days. Eighty-five percent of our

waterways are too polluted for fishing or swimming. We have more than 16,000 toxic waste sites. Many

workers toil in dangerous workplaces and much of our population lives near these industries. Yet, despite

the widespread fear of job losses, working people and communities are acting together to prevent these

hazards.</p><br>
        <img src="images/Mission.png"> 
        <h1 id="mission">MISSION</h1>
        <p>The New Jersey Work Environment Council (WEC) is an alliance of labor, community, and environmental

organizations working together for safe, secure jobs, and a healthy, sustainable environment. WEC links

workers, communities, and environmentalists through training, technical assistance, grassroots organizing,

and public policy campaigns to promote dialogue, collaboration, and joint action. Formed in 1986, WEC is the

nation's oldest state labor/environmental (or "blue/green") coalition.</p>

        <p><span id="sub-title">THE NEW JERSEY WORK ENVIRONMENT COUNCIL 25 YEARS OF UNITED ACTION</span><br>

For 25 years, volunteers, supporters, and staff have made WEC the nation's longest standing state

labor/environmental coalition dedicated to winning safe, secure jobs and a healthy, sustainable

environment. Leaders of the NJ Industrial Union Council (AFL-CIO) and the NJ Right to Know Coalition, which won the

nation's strongest state chemical right to know law in 1983, formed WEC in 1986. In 1999, WEC became a

membership coalition that now includes 70 member organizations. WEC is also the New Jersey affiliate of the

national BlueGreen Alliance, a partnership of 11 unions and four environmental groups.</p>

perhaps more than any of the other partnerships between blues and greens.”
