            <h1>About <span id="bio-title">Adam</span></h1>
            <p>
                CWA Local 1036 represents 7,300 public sector and healthcare workers in NJ. Adam works hard
every day to effectively represent a diverse membership, build union strength in the workplace,
and advocate for worker-friendly policies. CWA 1036 members keep our drinking water clean,
enforce workplace health regulations in public sector workplaces, ensure accessible open space,
parks and beaches, regulate and promote agricultural resources, and deliver critical public
services like newborn health screening, public health and terrorism lab analysis, HIV/ AIDS
services, and more. CWA Local 1036 represents government workers, including blue and white
collar county and municipal employees; nursing home workers; technical professionals and
scientists at the NJ State Departments of Environmental Protection, Health, and Agriculture;
County Assistant Prosecutors; and State Judiciary employees. During his two terms as Local
1036 President, Adam has focused on contract negotiations, particularly around the emerging
issues in health benefits costs and plan design under state law, and the implications of the
Affordable Care Act. He also has strengthened the Local’s political action program, making it a
Get-Out- The-Vote top performing local in the State.
In 2013, CWA 1036 working with labor and community allies, successfully worked to pass
ballot question #2 to raise NJ’s minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.25 per hour and include an
annual cost of living increase. Local 1036 is now working with coalition partners on creating
earned sick leave benefits for all workers in the state, creating workplace anti-bullying laws, and
tackling the complicated issues of the state budget and the future of public employee pensions.
Adam received his Bachelor of Arts in English, Summa Cum Laude, from Rutgers University,
New Brunswick. He also serves on the Board of Directors for Clean Water Action NJ and as
Treasurer of the Burlington County Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO. In his community, Adam
served three terms as Borough Council President in Frenchtown, NJ.
