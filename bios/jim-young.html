                Jim Young is Principal and Secretary, The Labor Institute, a 30-year- old labor education
organization, based in NYC. Jim has more than 20 years of experience working with unions and
labor coalitions and has been with The Labor Institute since 2005. He is currently leading the

closely with USW District 12, which covers 11 western states in the US, and with District 4,
which covers the Northeast, including New Jersey, New York, Delaware and New England. In
2006, Jim and the LI’s Les Leopold helped the United Steelworkers and Sierra Club found the

organizations dedicated to expanding the number and quality of jobs in a clean energy economy.
From 2006-2014, Jim served as BGA’s Vice President of Programs. He also authored or co-

(WEC), where he managed communications programs and helped launched the organization’s
Healthy Schools Program. Jim now serves on the WEC Board of Directors. A former full-time
journalist, Jim has written about labor rights, about workplace safety and health, and about the
                environment for <i>Newsday</i>, <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, <i>The Village Voice</i>, <i>The
