NJEA’s Hurricane Sandy Back-to- School Relief Program as well as the Sandy Ground

County Government Relations committee as well as the Gloucester County Legislative Action

Blistan co-founded and was the chair of the Gloucester County Education Commission (2007-
2009), where she created a positive forum for NJEA members to meet with legislators on
selected topics that affect both members and public education. Her efforts on this project served
as a model for other counties to successfully launch their own county education commissions.

appointed to be an official member of the NJ Hall of Fame Board of Commissioners and
currently is the chair of their education committee. Blistan also served on the NJEA Emergency
School Response Task Force, a committee created to work with the NJ Department of Homeland
Security to design emergency response plans in state public schools. She was a member of the
Partnership for Collaboration and Professional Learning, and served on the Evaluation Pilot
Advisory Committee (EPAC) where she assisted the Department of Education in making
recommendations to the Commissioner on effective practices for an evaluation system.
In 2003, Blistan was inducted into Delta Kappa Gamma Society International, a world-wide
professional educator’s organization.
A graduate of Camden County College and Glassboro State College (now Rowan University),
Blistan continued her graduate studies and earned a master’s degree in reading. Blistan holds
certificates as a teacher of the handicapped, reading, secondary English, and as a reading
specialist. She has also earned a supervisor of instruction certificate from Rowan University.
Blistan’s continued focus as NJEA vice president is for NJEA and all its members—certificated,
support professionals, retired, and student members— to continue to take the lead on the
discussion of New Jersey’s education progress in order to provide the best experience possible
for all public school children.
Blistan and her husband, Bob, a retired high school special education teacher in Washington
Township, live in Harrisonville. She has two sons, a daughter, and three grandchildren.            </p>
