        <h1>HEALTHY SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="primary-text">
        <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
        <p>With aging public schools, postponement of preventive maintenance, ongoing renovations, and planned construction, health and safety dangers often threaten students, teachers, and other school personnel. Poor indoor air quality, mold, asbestos, construction dust, and vermin are just some of these hazards.

        WEC's Healthy Schools program helps teachers and other school staff prevent workplace and environmental school hazards. We work primarily with the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA) and its local associations through technical consultation (such as through school inspections by WEC industrial hygienists), publications, and educational programs. In some situations, we also work with parent and community groups organizing around these issues.</p>
        
        <h1>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h1>
        <ul style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">
            <li>WEC helped prevent hazards in dozens of public schools through providing technical consultation and training to the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA). For example, in Keansburg and Phillipsburg, WEC met with local health and safety committees to address illnesses among staff that taught in mold-contaminated trailers and helped plan strategies to demand that the administrations remediate the mold. WEC also provided technical assistance to the Pinelands Education Association's health and safety committee. Sewer gases and copier exhaust fumes had sickened staff. The committee grieved lost pay and sick time caused by these unhealthy conditions. This grievance went to arbitration, where staff got back most of their sick time.</li>
            <li>WEC has written numerous articles for the monthly NJEA Reporter, which reaches more than 200,000 teachers, school nurses, and other staff. WEC also wrote much of the 350-page 2007 NJEA Health and Safety Manual, provided training at NJEA workshops and leadership conferences, and produced PowerPoint presentations for leaders on health and safety resources, and health and safety committees.</li>
            <li>WEC has pressed state agencies to better protect children, staff, and building trade workers from contaminated sites and hazards during school construction -- including poor indoor air quality -- through better coordination and accountability of six state agencies, including the Schools Development Authority. This process led to creation of the <a href='http://www.state.nj.us/health/healthyschools/' target="_blank">Healthy School Facility Environments</a> website, a gateway for resources to help parents, students, staff, administrators, architects, and contractors. WEC also wrote a <a href='http://www.edlawcenter.org/ELCPublic/AbbottSchoolFacilities/FacilitiesPages/Resources/Model_School_District_Policies.pdf' target="_blank">Model School District Policies for Protection of Staff and Students during Construction and Renovation</a>. </li>
