        <h1>INJURY ILLNESS PREVENTION PROGRAMS</h1>
        <p>Effective training about Injury and Illness Preventions Programs can help achieve safer, healthier, and more productive workplaces.

        WEC can provide free training at your workplace. This training includes free materials. The training is supported by a grant from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Training can be from two to eight hours.</p>
        
        <h1>About Prevention Programs</h1>
        <p>Every employer should have an overall injury and illness prevention program. Prevention programs improve health and safety conditions for both large and small employers, reduce workplace injuries and illnesses, improve compliance with laws and regulations, and reduce workers' compensation premiums.

        OSHA has announced that it will develop an Injury and Illness Prevention Program standard (rule) in the near future.</p>
        
        <h1>What It Will Require</h1>
        <p>If this standard is adopted, employers will be required to have a program to "find and fix" hazards. The standard will likely include the following elements:</p>
        
            <ul style='margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;'>
            <li>Management leadership</li>
            <li>Worker participation</li>
            <li>Hazard identification and assessment</li>
            <li>Hazard prevention and control</li>
            <li>Education and training</li>
            <li>Program evaluation, recordkeeping, and improvement</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        Each employer's program will be tailored to the size of the facility and the nature of the hazards workers face. How the six elements are covered will not be "one size fits all".

        WEC's curriculum covers key aspects of an effective workplace prevention program. Training introduces the concept of effective management systems and why facilities should establish a prevention program at their workplace.

        We also can provide training on related subjects, such as systems of safety and accident, incident, and near-miss investigations, focusing on root causes; employer and worker/union rights to participate during OSHA inspections; protection for whistle blowers, and development of effective safety and health committees.</p>
        
        <h1>Participatory Training Method</h1>
        <p>WEC's training relies on participatory activities. Instructors actively engage attendees and do not lecture. Participants work in small groups, learning important information, problem-solving, and developing critical thinking skills.</p>
        
        <h1>Materials</h1>
        <p>Participants receive <b>free</b> training materials.</p>
        
        <h1>Availability</h1>
        <p>WEC training is available <i>free</i> of charge to employers and labor organizations. In facilities where unions represent employees, provision of WEC training is coordinated with both the union and management.</p>
