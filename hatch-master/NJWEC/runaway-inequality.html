        <h1>RUNAWAY INEQUALITY</h1>
        
        <p id="runaway-quote"><i>“In the world working people inhabit,<br>our infrastructure is collapsing,<br>our schools are laying off teachers,<br>our drinking water is barely potable,<br>our cities are facing bankruptcy, and<br>our public and private pension funds are nearing collapse.<br>We – consumers, students and homeowners – are loaded with crushing debt, but our real wages haven’t risen since the 1970s.”</i><br><b>Les Leopold</b>, <i>Runaway Inequality</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Everyday working people just can’t seem to get ahead. We work longer and harder and still just can’t stretch
our paychecks. This doesn’t seem to impact the top 1%, and the very wealthy among us seem to play by a
separate set of rules. Something needs to be done to address what is happening in our economy.<br><br>
“Runaway inequality is at the root of many of the problems we face, including the meteoric and disastrous rise
of the financial sector, defunding of the public sector, environmental destruction, increased racial
discrimination, the gender gap in wages and the rise of our mammoth prison population...if we share a clear
understanding of runaway inequality – and the basic economic situation we face – we can begin to build a
common, broad-based movement for fundamental economic justice that will take on America’s economic
elites.” Les Leopold, Runaway Inequality.<br><br>
We know that corporate power and influence often thwarts progress on a range of public policies. Even when
there is clear preference on issues of public health, environmental protection, workers’ rights, and civil rights,
good public policy gets warped by narrow corporate interests and we lose. Time and again, business and
industry have aligned with the very wealthy to prevent progress on the minimum wage, earned sick time,
chemical safety, environmental safeguards, and worker health initiatives, among other issues.<br><br>
In partnership with The Labor Institute, NJEA, New Jersey Policy Perspective and others, WEC is taking action
by launching a new campaign focused on <i><b>reversing</b> runaway inequality</i>. We are working closely with allies on a
state-based plan to address the outsized influence of corporations, particularly the financial strip mining of our
economy by Wall Street firms. We’re tired of Wall Street raping the middle class.<br><br>
            This fall, WEC is hiring an organizer to work with Les Leopold, author of <b>Runaway Inequality</b>, and director of
The Labor Institute, to coordinate a large education initiative. We plan to build a broad-based alliance that will
connect existing statewide and local organizations in support of common goals and to push a state-based
policy agenda directly aimed at confronting corporate power in our state. Our opposition is organized, well
funded and tied to those in positions of power. We must feed new activists into our movement and motivate
them if we want to truly change the system.<br><br>
WEC represents more than 70 community, labor and environmental organizations, many of which already
recognize that economic inequality is a foundational challenge we all share, even if our specific policy agendas
sometimes differ. Many of us realize that until we address the fundamental inequities in our system, powerful,
moneyed interests will continue to limit or derail even good public policy with broad support. We will continue
to nibble at the edges and be told “there isn’t money” to address important priorities, unless we first rectify
the structural issues that allow the very few to gain outsized influence.<br><br>
“In the world working people inhabit,
our infrastructure is collapsing,
our schools are laying off teachers,
our drinking water is barely potable,
our cities are facing bankruptcy, and
our public and private pension funds are nearing collapse. We – consumers, students and homeowners – are loaded with crushing debt,
but our real wages haven’t risen since the 1970s.” Les Leopold, Runaway Inequality
We need your passion, your voice, your action.</p>
